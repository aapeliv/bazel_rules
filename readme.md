# Random bazel rules

This repo contains a bunch of rules for building random bits and pieces with bazel, I hope they're useful to someone. I've found it hard to learn bazel when there's very few examples out there, so I've dumped my working rules here in hopes it's useful! I've manually tested on macOS Mojave and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS with bazel 4.0.0 and clang (/whatever xcode ships with).

If you found them useful please star this repo or something so I know someone's using them!
