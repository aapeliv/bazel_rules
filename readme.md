# Random bazel rules

This repo contains a bunch of rules for building random bits and pieces with bazel, I hope they're useful to someone. I've found it hard to learn bazel when there's very few examples out there, so I've dumped my working rules here in hopes it's useful! I've manually tested on macOS Mojave and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.

If you found them useful please star this repo so I know someone's using them!
